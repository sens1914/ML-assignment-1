Recognize a Digit using Machine Learning

This project uses TensorFlow and Keras to build a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that recognizes handwritten digits (0–9) from the MNIST dataset. The dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images of size 28×28 pixels. Images are normalized for better training performance. The model is trained on 60,000 samples and tested on 10,000 samples, achieving high accuracy. It can predict digits from new handwritten images and visualize results.
